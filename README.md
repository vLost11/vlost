I began coding professionally in 1999, in 2004 I decided to leave the full time workforce in order to raise my children while only working remotely on per project basis.
I am now getting ready to return to full-time work, this project will be the beginings of an online protfolio to display my front-end HTML 5, CSS, Javascript abilities.

##I will create:
Resume Page with links to examples of my front-end skills.
Fine Art Gallery/Portfolio site, which will display my own Art.
